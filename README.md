# Sprint Review and Retrospective - SNHU Travel Project
**Course:** CS-250: Software Development Lifecycle  
**Student:** Moe Holder  
**Date:** February 2026

## Portfolio Artifact

This repository contains my Sprint Review and Retrospective from the SNHU Travel project, where I applied Scrum-Agile methodologies across multiple roles (Product Owner, Developer, Tester, and Scrum Master). This deliverable demonstrates my understanding of Agile principles, iterative development, and effective team collaboration in software development.

## Included Documents:

- **Sprint Review and Retrospective** (comprehensive analysis of the SNHU Travel development process)
- **Agile Presentation** (PowerPoint explaining Scrum-Agile to leadership)

## Portfolio Reflection

**How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating "user stories" help with this?**

  I was able to interpret users’ needs through intake meetings and Sprint reviews throughout the entire sprint. During the intake meeting, I was able to gather and document the stakeholders’ needs and requirements and align them with their business objectives. From there, I translated stakeholders’ desires into actionable development tasks that were used to create user stories.
  User stories helped structure what the stakeholders wanted, especially by using the format: As a [user type], I want to [action], so that I can [benefit]. This allowed me to view the requirements from a user perspective rather than focusing solely on technical implementation. User stories also ensured the team was aligned on product requirements.
  

**How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**

  I focus on iterative delivery, continuous feedback, adaptability, and disciplined software engineering principles. My approach is to use the Agile methodology, which provides enough structure to keep the team aligned with goals while allowing each team member the autonomy to complete their work efficiently without unnecessary interference.
  
  It is important to maintain continuous feedback with stakeholders; their input ensures that the product meets requirements and aligns with expectations. I also emphasize strong software engineering principles, creating modular, maintainable code that can be quickly adapted to changing requirements. Additionally, I incorporate test-driven development practices alongside implementation to ensure the code works as intended and remains free of defects.
  
  In my future development work, I plan to incorporate Agile processes such as Scrum artifacts, including daily stand-ups, sprint planning, sprint reviews, sprint retrospectives, and backlog refinement. I also consider code reviews essential, as they enable another developer to evaluate your work, offer a fresh perspective, and enhance the overall quality of the project.
  

**What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**

  Being a good team member, especially in an Agile environment, involves clear and proactive communication. This includes actively participating in Scrum ceremonies, following up to obtain necessary information, and being responsive to questions and concerns from the team.
  
  Being a reliable and accountable team member is also important. In self-organizing teams, you must complete the work you commit to within the agreed-upon timeframe.
Finally, being collaborative and solution-oriented is essential. A good team member voices concerns respectfully, advocates for product quality, remains open to compromise, and works with others to develop effective solutions.
